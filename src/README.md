# Title of the project

This project allows to read the orientation of the right arm estimated by three different sensors, a smartwatch, a kinect and a leap motion. The controller collects these data and evaluates the linear and the angular velocity to be sent to the robot in order to meve it. 

## The Systemâ€™s Architecture

The hardware is composed by a smartwatch, a kinect, a leap motion and the robot we want to move. The modules are wrote in cpp or in python.

### Description of the Modules
It describes all the modules within the architecture, i.e, (i) the inputs, (ii) the internal working, and (iii) the outputs.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites
It describes all hardwares and softwares that are required for running the system.

### How to run the project
It describes step by step how to download and run the project on a new computer.

## Results
It presents the result using (images or videos) of the working system, in (real or simulation).

## Recommendations
The Recommendations follow naturally from the conclusions. They describe: the assumptions made while building the system (and/or) the limitations of the working system. Therefore, presenting possible ideas that could overcome the limitations or assumptions.

# Useful GitHub readme syntax

## To make bullet points

* Do this
	* Do this

## To make hyper-link

For example, making a link to [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## To show, how to execute some commands in the terminal

    ```
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv3 #(should be already installed with previous point)
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv-apps
    ```

## To exphasize about a particular command

For example: Please do a ```catkin_make ```, once you have modified your code. 

## To add image(s) or video(s)
